Digital Lending Guidelines - FAQ
Q1: Whether a lending transaction would fall under the definition of digital 
lending only if all the processes in the life cycle of a loan, viz., customer 
acquisition, credit assessment, loan approval, disbursement, recovery, and 
associated customer service, are carried out digitally or some of the aforesaid 
processes can be carried out in physical mode also?
Ans: The phrase ‘largely by use of seamless digital technologies’ has been used in the 
Digital Lending definition to accord operational flexibility to REs in ‘Digital Lending’. 
Therefore, even if some physical interface with customer is present, the lending will still 
fall under the definition of Digital Lending. However, while doing so, the REs should 
ensure that the intent behind the Guidelines is adhered to.
Q2: Whether any service provider to whom RE has outsourced some of its credit 
intermediation activities would fall within the definition of Lending Service 
Provider (LSP) even if the lending transaction in question does not fall under the 
definition of ‘Digital Lending’?
Ans: Para 1 of the Annex I to the Circular dated September 02, 2022 specifies that 
these Guidelines are applicable to ‘Digital Lending’. Hence, only if a lending transaction 
qualifies under the definition of ‘Digital Lending’, will the service provider facilitating such 
lending be designated as LSP.
Q3: Whether all LSPs need to appoint Grievance Redressal Officers?
Ans: Only those LSPs which have an interface with the borrowers would need to 
appoint a nodal Grievance Redressal Officer. However, it may be reiterated that the RE 
shall remain responsible for ensuring resolution of complaints arising out of actions of all 
LSPs engaged by them.
Q4: Will EMI programmes on Credit Card undertaken in accordance with the 
Master Direction on Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct, 2022 be 
covered within the ambit on Digital Lending Guidelines?
Ans: EMI programmes on Credit Card are governed specifically by Para 6(b)(iii)1 of the 
‘Master Direction on Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct, 2022’. Such 
transactions shall not be covered under the Guidelines on Digital Lending. However 
other loan products offered on Credit Cards which are not covered/ envisaged under the 
aforesaid para of the Master Direction shall be governed by the stipulations laid down 
under the Guidelines on Digital Lending. Further, the Guidelines will also be applicable 
to all loans offered on Debit Card, including EMI programmes.
Q5: How to disclose APR in case of floating rate loans?
Ans: In case of floating rate loans, APR may be disclosed at the time of origination 
based on the prevailing rate as per the format of KFS. However, as and when the 
floating rate changes, only the revised APR may be disclosed to the customer via SMS/ 
e-mail each time the revised APR becomes applicable.
Q6: Is it mandatory to include insurance charges in the calculation of APR?
Ans: The insurance charges shall be included in the computation of APR only for the 
insurance which is linked/integrated in loan products as these charges are intrinsic to 
the nature of such digital loans.
Q7: Whether the flow of funds between the bank accounts of borrower and lender 
in a lending transaction can be controlled directly or indirectly by a third-party 
including LSP?
Ans: No
Q8: Can the services of Payment Aggregators (PA) be used for loan disbursals 
and repayments?
Ans: The principle underlying the Digital Lending Guidelines is that a LSP should not be 
involved in handling of funds flowing from the lender to the borrower or vice versa. 
While entities offering only PA services shall remain out of the ambit of ‘Guidelines on 
Digital Lending’, any PA also performing the role of an LSP must comply with the Digital 
Lending Guidelines.
Q9: In case of delinquent loans, recovery/ servicing of digital loans may be 
undertaken by a recovery agent collecting cash from borrowers. Will such cases 
be exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the RE’s bank 
account?
Ans: In case of delinquent loans, REs can deploy physical interface to recover loans in 
cash, where absolutely necessary. In order to afford operational flexibility to REs, such 
transactions are exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the RE’s 
bank account. However, any recovery by cash should be duly reflected in the borrower’s 
account and REs shall ensure that any fees, charges, etc., payable to LSPs are paid 
directly by them (REs) and are not charged by LSP to the borrower directly or indirectly 
from the recovery proceeds.
Q10: In certain cases, such as loan products involving advances against salary, 
though the loan is disbursed directly to the bank account of the borrower, the 
repayment is from the corporate employer, which deducts the EMI amount from 
the salary. Whether in such cases, it still has to be ensured that repayment is 
directly from the bank account of the borrower?
Ans: Such repayments can be allowed subject to the condition that the loan is repaid by 
the corporate employer by deducting the amount from the borrower’s salary. Further, 
REs should ensure that LSPs do not have any control over the flow of funds directly or 
indirectly in such transactions. It has also to be ensured that repayment is directly from 
the bank account of the employer to the RE.
Q11: For co-lending transactions, exemption has been granted from direct 
disbursal to the bank account of the borrower to the extent of flow of money 
between REs. Is such exemption available only for co-lending transactions 
undertaken for priority sector lending?
Ans: The exemption can be extended to co-lending arrangements between REs for non-
PSL loans subject to the condition that no third party other than the REs in a co-lending 
transaction should have direct or indirect control over the flow of funds at any point of 
time.
Q12: Whether the Guidelines are also applicable for corporate including MSME 
loans?
Ans: The Guidelines are applicable to all transactions meeting the definition of ‘Digital 
Lending’ as per Digital Lending Guidelines.
Q13: Whether the Guidelines are also applicable to mobile banking apps/websites 
of banks where, as an additional feature, personal loans or loans against deposits 
are being offered on the applications?
Ans: The Guidelines are applicable to ‘digital loans’ offered over any digital platform 
which meet the definition of ‘Digital Lending Apps/ Platforms’ (DLAs) as per our circular 
dated September 02, 2022 on Guidelines on Digital Lending.
Q14: Para 4.2 of the Digital Lending Guidelines mandate that penal interest/ 
charges levied shall be based on the outstanding amount of the loan. Whether 
penal interest/ charges can be levied on a lower base?
Ans: The amount under default shall act as the ceiling on which the penal charges can 
be levied.
Q15: Cheque bounce or mandate failure charges are levied on per 
instance/occurrence basis. Is it mandatory to annualize these charges also?
Ans: Penal charges such as cheque bounce/mandate failure charges, which are 
necessarily levied on a per instance basis may not be annualized. However, these 
charges must be disclosed separately in the KFS under ‘Details about Contingent 
Charges’.
Q16: Is processing fees required to be refunded if customer exits the loan during 
cooling-off period?
Ans: Reasonable one-time processing fee can be retained if the customer exits the loan 
during cooling-off period. This, if applicable, should be disclosed to the customer upfront 
in KFS. However, the processing fee has to be mandatorily included for the computation 
of APR.
Q17: Recovery agents are assigned by the lenders only when they turn 
delinquent. How can the lender then specify the details at the time of sanction?
Ans: At the time of sanction of loan, the borrower may be conveyed the name of 
empaneled agents authorized to contact the borrower in case of loan default. However, 
if the loan turns delinquent and the recovery agent has been assigned to the borrower, 
the particulars of such recovery agent assigned must be communicated to the borrower 
through email/SMS before the recovery agent contacts the borrower for recovery.
Q18: If APR is disclosed in KFS, is there a need to also disclose annualised rate 
of interest to the borrowers as required under Fair Practices Code applicable to 
NBFCs?
Ans: Yes.

Reserve Bank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025  

Chapter I: Preliminary 
1. Preamble 
Reserve Bank is statutorily mandated to operate the credit system of the country to 
its advantage. In this endeavour, Reserve Bank encourages innovation in the 
financial systems, products and credit delivery methods while ensuring orderly 
growth, financial stability and protection of depositors’ and borrowers’ interest. 
Certain concerns had emerged around the methods of designing, delivering and 
servicing digital credit products, which if not mitigated, may impact the borrower’s 
confidence in the digital lending ecosystem. The concerns primarily relate to 
unbridled engagement of third parties, mis-selling, breach of data privacy, unfair 
business conduct, charging of exorbitant interest rates, and unethical recovery 
practices. To address these concerns, pursuant to the recommendations made by 
the “Working Group on Digital Lending”, the Reserve Bank has, from time to time, 
issued guidelines to its regulated entities on digital lending. These Directions 
consolidate the earlier instructions along with certain new measures for 
arrangements involving Lending Service Providers partnering with multiple regulated 
entities as mentioned under para 6, and for creation of a directory of digital lending 
apps as mentioned under para 17 of these Directions. 
Accordingly, in exercise of powers conferred by sections 21, 35A and 56 of the

Directions. However other loan products offered on Credit Cards which are not 
covered/ envisaged under the aforesaid para of the Master Direction shall be

2021 and shall also not attract the provisions of ‘loan participation’ as defined

30. Repeal provisions 
i.	With the issuance of these Directions, the instructions/guidelines contained in the 
circulars mentioned in the Annex - III issued by RBI stand repealed.

Illustration 1  
Assume that as on April 1, 2024 the RE earmarks a portfolio of ?40 crore (out of the 
total sanctioned loans) under a DLG arrangement (DLG set). This portfolio shall remain 
"frozen" for the purpose of the specific DLG arrangement - meaning that no loan assets 
can be added or removed from it, except through loan repayment/ write-off. The RE can 
have such multiple DLG sets.  
The ceiling for DLG cover on such portfolio shall be fixed at ?2 crore (5% of ?40 crore), 
which shall get activated proportionately as and when the loans are disbursed.  
Illustration 2  
Assume that out of the above DLG set, loans amounting to ?10 crore are disbursed 
immediately. Then as on April 1, 2024, the DLG cover available for the portfolio shall be 
?0.5 crore (5% of disbursed). 
Subsequently, if loans of ?10 crore are further disbursed on April 15, 2024, the DLG 
cover shall proportionately increase to ?1 crore effective April 15, 2024.  
(Refer table below also for summary of each case) 
Case 1: As on June 30, 2024, loans worth ?5 crore mature without any default. In this 
case, the outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE would be ?15 crore and the DLG 
cover shall remain at ?1 crore. 
Case 2: Subsequently, there is a default of ?2 crore during Q2-2024 and consequently 
the RE invokes the entire DLG (?1 crore ). In this case, as of Sept 30, 2024 the 
outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE shall be ?15 crore (?20 crore original 
portfolio less ?5 crore loans matured without default) but no headroom for DLG will be 
available as the maximum permissible DLG cover of ?1 crore (5% of disbursed) has 
been exhausted.  
Case 3: Going further, let’s assume that recovery worth ?1 crore is made by the RE 
during October 2024 on the defaulted loans of ?2 crore. In such a case, the amount of 
the outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE as on October 31, 2024 shall come 
down to ?14 crore (?20 crore original portfolio less ?5 crore loans matured without any 
default less ?1 crore loans which were in default and recovered). However, the recovery 
amount of ?1 crore cannot be added to reinstate the DLG cover.
